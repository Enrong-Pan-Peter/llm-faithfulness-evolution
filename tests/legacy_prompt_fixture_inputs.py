"""Canonical inputs for the LEGACY variation-proposal prompt snapshots.

These cover the proposal call types of the modes that are NOT built on the
s/m/ml/l operator prompts:

- ``direct_llm_only_sequential``          -> ``next_guess``
- ``ea_llm``            -> ``specialize`` (crossover is shared with the operator
                          family and already captured under ``crossover.txt``)
- ``ea_llm_pivot``      -> ``specialize`` + ``pivot_morphology`` /
                          ``pivot_register_shift`` / ``pivot_adjacent_category`` /
                          ``pivot_fresh_adjacent_category``

Both the fixture generator and the snapshot test import this so they render from
identical inputs, using the real ``LLMClient`` code paths. The constructed
prompt is captured by stubbing ``_json_request_with_retry`` (every legacy
proposal method funnels its prompt through it, directly or via
``_request_json_list``).
