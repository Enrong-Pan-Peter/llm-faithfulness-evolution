"""calibration calibration analysis library (read-only over solver traces).

This package holds the analysis-side building blocks for the calibration/selection response audit
batch: reading solver traces, joining each self-reported individual to its
realized game rank, computing calibration metrics, an offline GloVe comparison
comparison, and cross-run reporting. Nothing here calls the network, runs the
solver, contacts an LLM, or writes to traces/caches; the modules only read the
trace and rank-cache files that already exist on disk.

Thin CLIs live in ``scripts/rq1_*.py`` and import from here so the logic stays
importable and unit-testable against synthetic fixtures.
