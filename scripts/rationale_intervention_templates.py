"""Fixed, seeded, string-level templates for the rationale intervention reason intervention.

Two arm libraries live here:

- Wrong-content reasons: assert a locally plausible but wrong relation. Each
  template MUST cite the real parent basis words (``{words}`` slot), so the
  intervention is content-level (the relation is wrong) while the referents are
  genuine. No LLM generates any of this text.
- Filler reasons: fixed generic sentences with no parent-derived tokens, chosen
  to be comparable in length to the genuine block they replace.

Admissibility: nothing here may contain the operator isolation guard's forbidden
substrings (see ``contexto_solver.operators.assert_prompt_has_no_sigma_leak``):
``"sigma"``, the sigma glyph, or ``"probability"`` (case-insensitive), and no
two-decimal numeric literals that could collide with a sigma component. This is
checked by :func:`assert_admissible` and by tests.
