"""Offline GloVe comparison comparison for calibration/selection response.

For a run whose hidden target is recoverable and present in the GloVe vocabulary,
we can score each proposed word with an offline GloVe cosine rank against that
target and ask three questions:

- ``glove_vs_real``: does the GloVe rank track the real game rank? (mediator
  fidelity; a positive Spearman rho means the offline proxy orders words like the
  real game does).
- ``closeness_vs_real``: does the operator's predicted_closeness track the real
  rank? (calibration; negative rho expected, since higher closeness should mean a
  smaller/closer rank).
- ``closeness_vs_glove``: does predicted_closeness track the GloVe proxy rank?
  (negative rho expected).

The GloVe rank is supplied as a callable ``ranker(word) -> int | None`` so this
module needs neither the embedding matrix nor the network and stays unit-testable
with a dict-backed fake. Runs with an unrecoverable target (unsolved api runs) or
an out-of-vocabulary target are skipped by the caller. No writes.
